						<dl class="faqs">
							<dt>Is it just me, or does Irving look a little like Jackie Chan?</dt>
						<dd>It's just you</dd>
						<dt>Do I really have to go through all this trouble?  Can't I just start coding?</dt>
						<dd>Of course you can just jump into the coding.  All shitty web developers do,  Just admit that you suck and you can skip all of these formalities.  Unfortunately, if "suck" is not the adjective you had in mind to describe your skill set, well, no, you can't really skip these steps.</dd>
						<dd>Sorry to be the one to have to break it to you.</dd>
