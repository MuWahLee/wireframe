						<h3>Introductio</h3>
						<p>OK,I don't know about you, but I'm reired of that boring Mojo site.  I want to build someting that's useful to me (or us).  So, I'm thinking <em>let's build a website for the pre-work</em>.  We can go through the process step by step.</p>
						<p>At first, at least, it will just ban an olf-fashined static website.  But maybe later we'll add some CoffeeScript and jQuery and have some fun.</p>
					</section>
					<section id="getting-started">
						<h3>Hooray! So how do we get started?</h3>
						<p>Well, the first thing we need to do is to gifure out what our site will do and who it will do it for.</p>
						<p>To this end, we'll begin by creating <em>personas</em> for our audience.  I can think of three different types of user who we might want to serve.</p>
						<p>Obviously, there are the <em>students</em>: you.  You are the primary audience as you'll be doing the lesson, so the site should put your needs foremost.</p>
						<p>Then there are the <em>instructors</em>, who are also the authors and editors of the content.  We'll need to think about them a bit, too.</p>
						<p>Finally, we might want to show the site off to others: friends, family, the course manager, curriculum folks, etc.  Let's call them <em>guests</em>.  So we should at least consider their needs</p>
						<p>So we'll creat three <em>personas</em> - student, instructor and guest - one for each type of user.</p>

						<h4>Measuring successful completion of this lesson</h4>
						<p>Hopefully, you've come away from this lesson understanding:</p>
						<ul class="measures">
							<li>How to create user <em>Personas</em> and why</li>
							<li>What the pros and cons are of <em>Personas</em></li>
							<li>That the most important thing is the Personas, but <em>understanding the needs and wants of your users</em></li>
							<li>How to write User Stories</li>
							<li>That there are several different formats for User Stories and little agreement on <em>how</em> to do them, but near complete agreement that you need to do <em>something</em> to determine your website's geature set and make sure it addressed the needs of your users</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
						<dl class="faqs">
							<dt>Is it just me, or does Irving look a little like Jackie Chan?</dt>
						<dd>It's just you</dd>
						<dt>Do I really have to go through all this trouble?  Can't I just start coding?</dt>
						<dd>Of course you can just jump into the coding.  All shitty web developers do,  Just admit that you suck and you can skip all of these formalities.  Unfortunately, if "suck" is not the adjective you had in mind to describe your skill set, well, no, you can't really skip these steps.</dd>
						<dd>Sorry to be the one to have to break it to you.</dd>
